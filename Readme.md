My Project is an application which refers to library systems used by librarian to manage the library using a computerized system where he/she can add new books. Books and student maintenance modules are also included in this system which would keep track of the students using the library and also a detailed description about the books a library contains. With this computerized system there will be no loss of book record or member record which generally happens when a non computerized system is used. All these modules are able to help librarian to manage the library with more convenience and in a more efficient way as compared to library systems which are not computerized.
